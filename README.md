# Salesforce-Lightning-Admin-Enhancer
Adds or fixes some missing functionality and user experience enhancements to the Salesforce Lightning Setup.

Current functionality includes:
 - Setting the Quick Find to have focus once page finishes loading.
 - Left aligning the Quick Find.
 - Minimizing some of the extra padding throughout the layout including the Sandbox label header.
 - Process Builder properties pane resizing and copy input values functionality.
 - Add custom Favorite Quick Links to the Home Nav Rail.

All enhancements are based on the post rendering of the lightning page. This means, if / when Salesforce changes the layout, features may break. 

Please let suggestions and comments.
Thanks.
