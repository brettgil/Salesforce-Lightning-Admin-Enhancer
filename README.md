# Salesforce-Lightning-Admin-Enhancer
Adds or fixes some missing functionality and user experience enhancements to the Salesforce Lightning Setup.

All options can be turned on or off from the extension's options page. (Right click > Options)

All enhancements are based on the post rendering of the lightning page. This means that if / when Salesforce changes the layout, features may break. 

Please leave suggestions and comments.
Thanks.
